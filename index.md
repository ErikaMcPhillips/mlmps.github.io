**Goals:**


1) Integrating statistical emulators and numerical solvers for speeding up forward prediction/inverse estimation, in particular on problems with huge/infinite dimensional input space 

2) Accelerating machine learning (e.g. Gaussian process) methods while maintaining accuracy. 


3) Unifying data assimilation (e.g. EnKF) with spatio-temporal/emulation approaches.
